# 2D Kirigami Deployment Simulator
This code simulates the 2D deployment process of a kirigami pattern given its tile geometry and connectivity. The code is written in Python with the 2D rigid body physics library Pymunk utilized.

A set of deployable quasicrystal patterns (5-fold Penrose, 8-fold Ammann-Beenker, 12-fold Stampfli) have been included as examples.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome.
